WEBORA LOGO TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

If your logo is not displaying correctly, try these solutions in order:

1. VERIFY FILE LOCATION
   Make sure "webora-logo.png" exists in the root folder (c:\Users\aatif\Downloads\Webora\)
   The file name is case-sensitive on some servers - ensure it's exactly "webora-logo.png"

2. CHECK BROWSER CACHE
   Try clearing your browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R on Mac)
   Or open the site in incognito/private browsing mode

3. COMMON ISSUES & SOLUTIONS:
   - File format: Make sure it's a PNG image
   - File permissions: Ensure the file is readable by the web server
   - File size: The logo should be approximately 40x40 pixels

4. ALTERNATIVE PLACEMENT:
   If the issue persists, try creating an "images" folder and placing the logo there:
   c:\Users\aatif\Downloads\Webora\images\webora-logo.png
   
   Then update the HTML files to use:
   <img src="images/webora-logo.png" ... >

5. CHECK CONSOLE:
   Open your browser's developer tools (F12) and check the Console tab
   Look for any errors related to loading the image
   The debugging script we added will provide helpful information

If the logo still doesn't appear, the fallback "W" logo will be shown automatically.
